1. **User Interface**:
   - Developed a user-friendly interface using React components.
   - Organized components for user management, client management, disease management, and vaccination management.

2. **Routing**:
   - Utilized React Router for client-side routing to navigate between different views/components.

3. **Forms and Input Handling**:
   - Implemented forms and input fields to capture user input for creating and updating data.
   - Validated user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.

4. **API Integration**:
   - Integrated with the backend API endpoints using asynchronous HTTP requests (e.g., Axios).
   - Made API calls to perform CRUD operations on users, clients, diseases, and vaccinations.

5. **State Management**:
   - Managed application state using React's built-in state and props mechanism or state management libraries like Redux, depending on the complexity of the application.

By following this structured approach, the system effectively manages user data, client information, disease records, and vaccination details while providing a seamless user experience through the React frontend.
